  Examples of valid inputs: # kg" # gr, # km, # mm, #kg, #gr, #km, #mm 
  (kg = kilograms, gr = grams, km = kilometers, mm = milimeters)
  
Next in the To box input only the unit you want to convert to (only pounds, ounces, miles, or inches)
  Examples of valid inputs: lb, oz, mi, in
  (lb = pounds, oz = ounces, mi = miles, in = inches)
  
Final step is to click the Convert button and it will give you a # of either "lb", "oz", "mi", or "in" in the To box

Warnings:

  If you dont put in the right units for each conversion and click the Convert button it will say "Invalid" in the To box
  If you dont put anything in the either of the boxes it will say "Invalid" when clickng the Convert button
